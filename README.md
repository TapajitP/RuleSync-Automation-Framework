# RuleSync-Automation-Framework
Automates critical workflows, including data sanitization, processing, rule execution, SQL statement generation, and Table of Contents creation for Excel-based datasets. Designed to enhance accuracy, consistency, and operational efficiency, the system processes data through various validated scripts.

The automation project involves a set of Python scripts designed to drastically reduce the time required for processing complex Excel data transformations and validations. Historically, this task took 15 working business days, but with automation, it now completes in 2–3 minutes, showcasing a remarkable ~99.6% reduction in processing time. Below is a detailed professional summary tailored for non-technical stakeholders.

Problem: A labour-intensive, error-prone manual process of validating, sanitizing, and executing business-to-technical rule mappings from large Excel files.

Solution: The automation scripts achieve:
1.	Faster processing with precise execution.
2.	Reduction in human dependency and operational risks.
3.	Improved auditability with logs at every stage.

Key Use Cases

Data Validation and Cleansing:
•	Automates validation and cleansing of raw Excel data to eliminate redundancies, errors, and inconsistencies.
•	Ensures normalized, sanitized, and structured data suitable for downstream processes.

Business-Technical Rule Mapping:
•	Converts business rules into SQL-style technical rules for database execution.
•	Simplifies complex relationships between tables using predefined logic.

Automated Rule Execution:
•	Executes database queries to validate rules, ensuring reliable insights.
•	Dynamically identifies issues like missing data, errors, or mismatches.

Audit and Compliance Reporting:
•	Logs detailed step-by-step execution for traceability and legal compliance.
•	Automatically generates a Table of Contents (TOC) summarizing data statuses and validations.

Technical Overview:

Core Technologies Used:
•	Python: The main programming language for building scalable automation.
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
•	SQLite: As an intermediate lightweight database to handle data queries.
•	Excel Automation Libraries (openpyxl, xlwings): For direct interaction with Excel files.
•	Subprocess Management: For seamless orchestration of dependent scripts.

Pipeline Workflow:
The IntelliFlowMasterX orchestrates the entire pipeline:
•	DataSanitizerX cleanses and standardizes data.
•	DataProcessorX generates SQL-like SELECT and WHERE clauses.
•	FromStatementGenerator dynamically creates FROM clauses with table relationships.
•	ExcelSanitizerSQLiteLoader loads sanitized data into SQLite for robust intermediate querying.
•	RuleExecutorX validates business rules with data and outputs insights into Excel sheets.
•	GenerateTOC creates a TOC summarizing validation statuses.

Quantitative Impact

Efficiency:
•	Processes now run 300x faster.
•	Eliminates dependency on manual intervention for repetitive tasks.

Cost Savings:
•	Labor reduction: Fewer person-hours needed.
•	Accuracy: Reduced rework and error correction.

Scalability:
•	The solution can handle multiple files and rules simultaneously, ensuring future-proof scalability.

Use Case: Validating 500 Rules Against 1,000 Excel Files

Business Scenario: A multinational corporation needs to validate 500 business rules against 1,000 Excel files. These rules, defined in business terms, ensure data integrity, compliance, and proper relationships between master and transactional datasets. Each Excel file represents operational data, such as sales, inventory, or vendor details, across various regions and business units.

Challenges:
•	Volume of Data: The sheer volume of 500,000 rule validations (500 rules × 1,000 files) makes manual execution infeasible.
•	Complexity of Rules: Business rules involve conditions like joins between datasets, quality checks (e.g., null values, duplicates), and specific calculations.
•	Time Constraints: With deadlines for regulatory compliance or quarterly reporting, manual validation could take months.
•	Error Risk: Manual processes are prone to human error, leading to compliance risks and operational inefficiencies.

How the Automation Scripts Help?
Pipeline Execution: The IntelliFlowMasterX pipeline automates every stage:

•	DataSanitizerX: Cleanses and standardizes all 1,000 Excel files, ensuring uniformity for validation.
•	DataProcessorX: Transforms the 500 business rules into SQL-style technical rules.
•	FromStatementGenerator: Constructs FROM clauses dynamically for inter-table relationships.
•	ExcelSanitizerSQLiteLoader: Loads data into SQLite for efficient intermediate querying.
•	RuleExecutorX: Executes the SQL rules for all 1,000 files and generates detailed outputs.
•	GenerateTOC: Produces a summary Table of Contents for quick review of results.

Time Savings:
•	Manual Process: Assuming 30 minutes to validate one rule for one file, the task would take 250,000 hours (500,000 validations × 0.5 hours).
•	Automated Process: With the scripts, validation for all 1,000 files can be completed in ~24 hours, depending on system resources.
